The product is powered by a cryptocurrency network called Syscoin, a leading blockchain platform based on the Bitcoin protocol. With Blockchain Foundry, Syscoin has already partnered with Microsoft as a member of Microsoft Azure’s Blockchain-as-a-Service (“BaaS”) platform.

Blockchain Foundry Inc. develops and commercializes blockchain-based business solutions in the Americas and the Caribbean. Its solutions include Syscoin Spark Wallet that allows clients to have their custom wallet based on their syscoin platform token; Syscoin Price Peg Server, which allow non-coders to create and configure its own price peg server; and Blockmarket suite, a marketplace platform. The company also provides consulting services to corporate clients seeking to incorporate blockchain technology into their business. It has a partnership with BIGG Digital Assets Inc. to develop an integrated forensic and risk scoring product for syscoin-based tokens.

## Significance

Blockchain Foundry's mission is to disrupt markets by leveraging the potential of blockchain technology. They remove middlemen, clearing houses and other such mechanisms that negatively affect your bottom line. It can also lead to errors, mistakes and security breaches. This type of technology is especially critical in markets where a one-minute supply chain inefficiency can lead to massive revenue increases. They believe blockchains will fundamentally change how organizations think about doing business.

They believe in the "right tool for the right job". We're focused on applications of blockchain technology outside the financial sector. They also offer blockchain consulting services for those interested in exploring what benefits a private blockchain might bring to their organization.
